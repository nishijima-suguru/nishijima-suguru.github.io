I’m a computational biologist at the Life Science Data Research Center, the University of Tokyo, where I study the microbiome, with a particular focus on the human gut — one of the most diverse microbial ecosystems in the body. My research combines large-scale metagenomics and machine learning to understand how gut microbial and viral communities vary across individuals, and how these patterns relate to human health and disease. I’m broadly interested in the function and evolution of bacteria and viruses, and in the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape these complex systems.

Originally from Japan, I completed my PhD at the University of Tokyo, where I became fascinated by microbial ecosystems and their intricacies. I then moved to Germany for postdoctoral training at EMBL before returning to Japan to continue exploring microbiome science.
